Task 1:

// Under this line write a message to yourself from GitHub

Hi, I'm Kedar and I'm a freshman at Purdue in CS193!

// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does

git fetch updates the stream with commits not made on the terminal, but made on the github desktop, so that commits are on the same stream.

Task 2:

// Under this line describe why we need to run 'git push' after making a commit

git push needs to be run so that the changes are actually made to the remoterepository hosted on git. If it's not, the changes are only stored locally, and not ever moved to the remote repository.

Task 3:

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-A'

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-B'

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-C'

// END OF LAB 4
